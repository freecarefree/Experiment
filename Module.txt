I18N

Encoding: use the UTF-8 (Unicode) character encoding for content, databases, etc. Always declare the encoding.
Language: declare the language of documents and indicate internal language changes.
Navigation: on each page include clearly visible navigation to localized pages or sites, using the target language.
Escapes: use characters rather than escapes (e.g. &#xE1; &#225; or &aacute;) whenever you can.
Forms: use UTF-8 on both form and server. Support local formats of names/addresses, times/dates, etc.
Localizable styling: use CSS styling for the presentational aspects of your page. So that it's easy to adapt content to suit the typographic needs of the audience, keep a clear separation between styling and semantic content, and don't use 'presentational' markup.
Images, animations & examples: if your content will be seen by people from diverse cultures, check for translatability and inappropriate cultural bias.
